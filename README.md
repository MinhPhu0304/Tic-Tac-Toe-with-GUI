# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-GUI
This is a project I made to learn more about making GUI in C
## Notes:
  * The library I used to make this GUI is from  Microsoft so it is platform dependent. It could only be ran on Window computer
  * If you don't want to read the source code and jump right to the program, you can down load the execution version of it [here](https://github.com/MinhPhu0304/Tic-Tac-Toe-with-GUI/blob/master/Tic-Tac-Toe%20GUI/Debug/12x06c%20-%20Tic-Tac-Toe%20GUI.exe) then click view raw.

**More feature is coming soon**
Right now we can restart the game but I might add time travel feature whenever I have time
## How to Play
  You can look it up on Google about how to play tic tac toe. But the game doesn't have human vs computer mode so either you have to find another player or play it with yourself. The image bellow is what you will get when run the game
